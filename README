A Java library used for reading SPSS .sav files.

This is a fork of an Open Data Foundation project created by Pascal Heus (pheus@opendatafoundation.org). The original project can be found at: http://opendatafoundation.org/?lvl1=forge

The main, planned improvement is to allow the library to read SPSS files that do not use an UTF-8 character encoding.
